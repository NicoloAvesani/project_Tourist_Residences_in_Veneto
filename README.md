NICOLO' AVESANI VR490189 
PROGRAMMING FINAL PROJECT 2022-2023

I'm Nicol√≤ Avesani, Data Science student in Verona. 
My project is focused on a dataset called 'Tourist Residences in Veneto'.

There are two files with the code of my project : 'project_on_colab.ipynb'(with the development of the code) and 'project_streamlit.py'(with the python code and the code for the streamlit presentation).

I divided the code into 5 sections: 
- INTRO AND LEGEND (I give some information on the dataset)
- EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- PLOTS (Show some intresting plots)
- CORRELATION AND HEATMAP (Find correlation between variables and plot into heatmap)
- MODEL (Linear regression model)

The aim of the project is to analyze the Tourist Residences in Veneto and find out how the relation between descriptive variables(independent variables) and the TR classification (dependent variable) change by increasing/decreasing the classification.
Results are visible by changing the classification on the model.
